# CodeXtreme Solution Propossal - Team System Interrupt

Our Android application, designed to promote a direct recyclable to recycling center ecosystem through crowdsourcing and gamification.

Our app, created using Android Studio, aims to make recycling more accessible and enjoyable for users by allowing them to easily locate the nearest recycling center and earn rewards for their contributions. By incorporating gamification elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards, we hope to incentivize users to recycle more frequently and compete with others in their community to make a positive impact on the environment.

Key features of our application include:

Recycling Center Locator: Users can easily find the nearest recycling center using our app's GPS feature.

Point System: Users can earn points for every item they recycle, which can then be used to redeem rewards.

Badges and Leaderboards: We offer a variety of badges to recognize users who have achieved specific milestones or made significant contributions. We also have a leaderboard to highlight the top contributors in each community.

Community: Our app encourages users to connect with one another and share tips on recycling, reducing waste, and promoting sustainability.

We believe our app has the potential to make a significant impact on the environment by increasing the rate of recycling and promoting sustainable practices. We invite you to check out our GitHub repository to learn more about our development process and contribute to our project.
